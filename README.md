# Jolia's Video Player For CVR

NOTICE: This version is a early version, you can use it but it does not have as many features as the CVR's in-built version. Also the UI isn't that great and will be improved. 

This video player is more if you want a more compact version, if you want playlists support, volume control and etc please use the official version. (You can still set playlist inside unity however there no where to sellect them in-game with this video player.

There are two versions.

Version 0.0.1 Features:

Features:
- Smaller and compact.
- Play and pause button.
- Mute buttons.

Version 0.1 Features: This version is not tested due to CVR servers being down, but should work.
- Better UI then 0.0.1.
- Smaller and compact.
- Play and pause button.
- Mute buttons.
- Volume control (Not tested).
- Dark Screeen mode (Not Tested).
- Audio player only version (Not Tested).

That's about it.

Things I am working on, (note some features may not be released for a while unto CVR makes it easier to make custom players):

- Add to play list, E.G you enable playlist mode, you add a video and it get's added to the playlist, so after a video stop playing it will play the next in queue, please note I not sure if this is possible yet.
- Improving the UI further.
- Adding optional models for TV and speakers.
- Possible audio link intergration? (MAYBE).
