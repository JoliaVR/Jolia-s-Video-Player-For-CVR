# Jolia's Video Player For CVR

NOTICE: This version is a early version, you can use it but it does not have as many features as the CVR's in-built version. Also the UI isn't that great and will be improved. 

This video player is more if you want a more compact version, if you want playlists support, volume control and etc please use the official version. (You can still set playlist inside unity however there no where to sellect them in-game with this video player).

- You can also get this off Gumroad: Coming Soon.

Requirments:
- Unity 2019.4.31f1
- ChilloutVR CCK 3.3
- Basic Unity and CVR knowledge.
- TextMeshPro - You can get this via Unity's package manager, it is free. We use a font from there.


Version 0.1.1 Features:
- Smaller and compact.
- Play and pause button.
- Mute buttons.
- Volume control.
- Dark Screeen mode.
- Audio player only version.

Known Issues: 
Volume control does not work, this may not work unto CVR allows more control on things.

That's about it.

Things I am working on, (note some features may not be released for a while unto CVR makes it easier to make custom players):

- Add to play list, E.G you enable playlist mode, you add a video and it get's added to the playlist, so after a video stop playing it will play the next in queue, please note I not sure if this is possible yet.
- Improving the UI further.
- Adding optional models for TV and speakers.
- Possible audio link intergration? (MAYBE).
